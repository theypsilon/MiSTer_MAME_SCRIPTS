#Q: How does it work?
#A: Download it to the Scripts Directory and run it like any other MiSTer update script. This script looks for .mra files in _Arcade and its recursive directories and tries to download the MAME merged set zip files listed in the .mra files. At the bottom of the script is a list of all the merged MAME roms for the .220 set. Only rom files with names that match this list will be downloaded.  
#
#Q: Can I set my own custom loactions for MRA and MAME files? 
#A: A /media/fat/Scripts/update_hbmame-getter.ini file may be used to set custom location for your HBMAME files and MRA files.
#Add the following line to the ini file to set a directory for MRA files: MRADIR=/top/path/to/mra/files
#Add the following line to the ini file to set a directory for HBMAME files: ROMDIR=/path/to/hbmame
#
#Q:Will this script over write files I already have?
#A:NO, This script will not clober files you already have. You need to manaully remove any files you have if you want to download new files.
#
#A Merged set contains all of the files for every Clone version of a Parent game.
#
#USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - THIS COMES WITHOUT WARRANTE AND MAY KILL BABY SEALS.
